### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because I was interested in seeing how code works when trying to convert units of systems. I figured out how to write code that will convert, created code that will help others in the future.

 * Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because I got to try writing date difference code but with functions. I was able to figure out how to become more organized with code, and it was around this time I was getting a hang of the formating.

*  Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was a favorite because I got to figure out how to create art with code using text. I was able to get creative with my code and create my first textual display.
